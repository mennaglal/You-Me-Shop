# **CartOfProducts-TaskLaravel**


##  **Website Description:**
You & Me Shop is a two-part online shopping website. The administrator can control part of the dashboard. It is he who allows each employee of the site system to see only the part that gives him his permissions. Also, the administrator adds categories and products for each category and sees customer data, customer orders, and customer invoices. The second part is the web page that appears for the customer to choose the products they want to buy and put them in the shopping cart. He can update the quantity of each product he wants to buy, delete it, or delete all the products on the card. When the customer selects the products in the shopping cart, the customer places an order and must enter their information to complete the order and receive their invoice. At this point, an email is sent with the total amount to be paid to the customer, and when he presses the button on the email he goes to see his invoice.
